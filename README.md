# Customer Churn Analysis in the Telecom Industry

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset containing customer demographics, service details, and payment history to predict churn and identify key factors influencing customer retention. The goal is to provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifies churn patterns using visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Network
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares models based on accuracy, specificity, and interpretability.
- **Business Insights**: Provides recommendations for reducing churn and improving customer retention.

## Technologies Used
- **R** (Primary programming language)
- **Caret** (Machine learning modeling)
- **RandomForest** (Ensemble learning)
- **rpart & rpart.plot** (Decision tree modeling)
- **Neuralnet** (Neural network implementation)
- **ROSE** (Class balancing)
- **Dplyr & GGplot2** (Data manipulation and visualization)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("caret", "randomForest", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "neuralnet", "ROSE", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))
   ```

2. **Load Dataset**:
   Ensure the dataset `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` is in the working directory.
   ```r
   data <- read.csv("Telco-Customer-Churn.csv")
   ```

3. **Run Analysis**:
   Execute the R script `main.R` to preprocess data, train models, and generate insights.
   ```r
   source("main.R")
   ```

## Insights Gained
- **High churn risk** among customers with month-to-month contracts and high monthly charges.
- **Early churn** is prevalent within the first 3â€“6 months of tenure.
- **Service bundling** and **loyalty incentives** can improve retention rates.
- **Random Forest model** provides the most stable and accurate predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop a real-time churn prediction dashboard.
- Implement customer segmentation for personalized retention strategies.
- Expand analysis to include external factors such as customer reviews and competitor pricing.
